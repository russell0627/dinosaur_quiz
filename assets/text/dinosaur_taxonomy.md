- Ankylosaurs are any creatures under the suborder Ankylosauria. They are herbivorous Cretaceous dinosaurs that had plates of armor on their backs, legs and heads. Most Ankylosaurs had one weakness which was their underbelly which wasn't armored.
- Ceratopsians are quadrupedal herbivores of a group found in the Cretaceous period, including Triceratops. They had large beaked and horned heads and bony frills protecting the neck.
- Ornithopods are bipedal herbivorous dinosaurs.
- Hadrosaurs or duck-billed dinosaurs, are part of the Ornithschian family hadrosauridae. Their defining feature is the flat duck-bill like appearance of the bones in their snouts.
- Pachycephalosaurs were bipedal herbivorous dinosaurs from the late Cretaceous period. They had thick domed skulls used for ramming other dinosaurs.
- Pterosaurs were most of the flying archosaurs such as Pteranodon, Pterodactyl, and Quetzalcoatlus. Technically Pterosaurs are not dinosaurs, they are Archosaurs (They are part of Archosauria) because they are not a part of Dinosauria.
- Sauropods were the large herbivores of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods that had long necks and tails, a small head and 5 toed limbs on which they tended to walk in a digitigrade fashion.
- Stegosaurs were small headed quadrupedal herbivorous dinosaurs of the Jurassic and early Cretaceous periods with a double row of large bony plates or sines along the back. The name Stegosaurus means roof-lizard.
- Theropod means "Beast Footed". All theropods were characterized by 3 toes and claws on each limb like the Tyrannosaurus, Spinosaurus, and Therizinosaurus.

If you were to look at all the points in the complex list of clades and orders for one dinosaur it would look like this:

- Kingdom: Animalia
- Phylum: Chordata
- Clade: Dinosauria
- Order: Ornithschia
- Suborder: Ceratopsia
- Family: Ceratopsideae,
- Subfamily: Chasmosaurinae
- Tribe: Triceratopsini
- Genus: Triceratops
- Species: horridus or prorsus


The highest Clade in the taxonomy tree is Dinosauria which says that that animal is a dinosaur pterosaurs however have Archosauria instead
as they are Archosaurs not Dinosaurs.

Under that is the Order of the Dinosaur That can be either Ornithschia ("bird-hipped") or Saurischia("lizard-hipped").
- Saurischia contains Sauropoda and Theropoda
- Ornithschia contains all other suborders like Ceratopsia and Ankylosauria

The Suborder of a dinosaur can tell you some of the main characteristics of that dinosaur:
- Ankylosauria tells you that the dinosaur has body armor and is a herbivore
- Ceratopsia tells you that the dinosaur has a frill on the back of its head and horns or "bosses" in the case of Pachyrhinosaurus
- Sauropoda tell you that it is a long-necked and long-tailed herbivore
- Theropoda tells you that it stands on 2 legs and has 3 toes with claws like the Raptors

The Family of a dinosaur is a group of dinosaurs that share a common ancestor and share common characteristics.
The Family Ceratopsidae includes the subfamilies:
- Centrosaurinae
- Ceratops
- Chasmosaurinae
- Dysaganus
- Polyonax

The Subfamily of a dinosaur is a taxonomic rank that is below Family and contains more than a genus. The Subfamily Chasmosaurinae contains:
- Agujaceratops
- Anchiceratops,
- Arrhinoceratops
- Bisticeratops
- Bravoceratops
- Chasmosaurus
- Coahuilaceratops
- Judiceratops
- Kosmoceratops
- Mercuriceratops
- Navajoceratops
- Pentaceratops
- Sierraceratops
- Spiclypeus
- Terminocavus
- Titanoceratops
- Utahceratops
- Vagaceratops
- Triceratopsini

All the items in that list are individual species of dinosaur except for Triceratopsini which is a Tribe of dinosaurs

In taxonomy a Tribe is a rank that is below Subfamily and Family and above genus it can be divided into Subtribes. it is normal for all taxonomic ranks from genus upwards to be capitalized. The Tribe Triceratopsini contains:
- Agathaumas,
- Eotriceratops,
- Nedoceratops,
- Ojoceratops,
- Regaliceratops,
- Torosaurus,
- Triceratops.

When most people talk about Triceratops they just say Triceratops which is only the Genus Triceratops there are two known species of triceratops which are "horridus" or "prorsus" but Triceratops is only the genus. Genus is the classification right above the species of an animal. The Genus Triceratops has two species:

- Triceratops horridus
- Triceratops prorsus

They are both very similar but are slightly different and that makes them different species.
Tyrannosaurus almost had two more species other than rex, but they decided that they were actually just the same dinosaur with normal variations.
